RICHARD'S LOG 01:
David's birthday is 10 days away, and I was thinking of making a surprise for his birthday. But I'm not sure what kind of surprise to make yet.

RICHARD'S LOG 02:
I talked with Sam the other day; he's one of the biologists at MIRAGETECH. He said he knows exactly what kind of surprise we could make for him.

RICHARD'S LOG 03:
I tried asking him for a few days already what kind of surprise it would be, but he never told me. The only thing he said was that David would love it.

RICHARD'S LOG 04:
Today's date is July 11, 2015. There are only 5 more days until his birthday. I really hope David will actually love what Sam has planned for him.

LIAM'S LOG 05:
Emery keeps saying she doesn't know if everything we are doing is worth it, but I always remind her that the company knows what they are doing, so we should be fine.
