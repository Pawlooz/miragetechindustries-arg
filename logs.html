David's birthday is 10 days away, and I was thinking of making a surprise for his birthday. But I'm not sure what kind of surprise to make yet.

<span class="log-title">RICHARD'S LOG 02:</span>
I talked with Sam the other day; he's one of the biologists at MIRAGETECH. He said he knows exactly what kind of surprise we could make for him.

<span class="log-title">RICHARD'S LOG 03:</span>
I tried asking him for a few days already what kind of surprise it would be, but he never told me. The only thing he said was that David would love it.

<span class="log-title">RICHARD'S LOG 04:</span>
Today's date is July 11, 2015. There are only 5 more days until his birthday. I really hope David will actually love what Sam has planned for him.

<span class="log-title">LIAM'S LOG 03:</span>
Emery keeps saying she doesn't know if everything we are doing is worth it, but I always remind her that the company knows what they are doing, so we should be fine.
